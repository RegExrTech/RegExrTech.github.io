    <h3>About The Universal Scammer List</h3>
    <p>
      The Universal Scammer List is the system supporting a collection of subreddits who agree to
      work together to limit the impact that those who have scammed or have shown the intention to
      scam can have on members of Buy/Sell/Trade communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document assumes that you are a moderator of a subreddit participating in the Universal
      Scammer List (USL). If you are looking to see if a user is banned, please check
      <a href="/">the main search page</a> instead. If you are interested in having your subreddit
      join the USL, please check <a href="/start">the Getting Started page</a> instead.
    </p>
    <h3>Issuing a Ban</h3>
    <p>
      If a user needs to be banned from your community and you want that ban to carry through to the
      entire USL, ban the user as normal but be sure to include a "usl tag" in the
      <b>MOD NOTE</b> of the ban. A tag is a # character, followed by a single word (like #scammer).
      These tags tell the USL bot that it should propagate the ban to the list and issue
      corresponding bans to the subreddits that subscribe to the relevant tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that bans can include multiple tags! If you feel that someone is worthy of multiple
      descriptive words, you can include multiple tags in the mod note of the ban.
    </p>
    <h3>Removing a Ban</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>If you wish to remove a ban, you can simply unban the user.</strong> Any tags assigned
      by your subreddit will automatically be removed from the USL. If you wish to have
      finer-grained control over which tags are removed, please send a message to your
      subreddit-specific USL bot with the following text in the body:
    </p>
    <p><code>$unban u/test_account #usltag</code></p>
    <p>
      Where <code>u/test_account</code> is the name of the user you wish to unban and
      <code>#usltag</code> is the tag you wish to remove. Doing so will remove the tag(s) in
      question from the user on the USL. If the tag(s) removed result in the user not having any
      tags to which a subreddit is subscribed, that user will be unbanned from that subreddit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if a user is banned from r/FunkoSwap with the tags #scammer and #sketchy, the
      user will be banned on all subs that subscribe to either of those tags. However, if the
      moderators of r/FunkoSwap decide that the user is, in fact, not a scammer, but still sketchy,
      the mods of r/FunkoSwap can remove the #scammer tag with the above command. When this happens,
      any subreddits that subscribe to the #scammer tag but NOT to the #sketchy tag will have this
      user unbanned from their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that ONLY moderators of the subreddit from which the ban originated can remove a
      USL ban in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to ONLY allow unbans to happen via DM to the bot, set the
      <code>local_unban_is_usl_unban</code> value in your subreddit config to <code>false</code>.
      This will disable the feature and enforce that only unbans issued via DM to the bot will be
      accepted.
    </p>
    <h3>Modifying a Ban</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to add another tag to a banned user, you must first locally unban the user (aka
      through subreddit config, NOT via PM to the bot) and then <i>reban</i> the user, including ALL
      tags that you wish to apply to the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Common Tags</h3>
    <p>The following tags are common tags which can be used to ban a user in any subreddit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>scammer</li>
      <li>sketchy</li>
      <li>compromised</li>
      <li>troll</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you wish to add more tags, please contact RegExr either via Reddit or Discord with your
      request.
    </p>
    <h3>Private Tags</h3>
    <p>
      Some communities use the USL to propagate bans between communities that are unrelated to
      scamming. Considering this is the Universal <b>SCAMMER</b> List, these bans are not relevant
      to the majority of users. As such, these bans will be tracked by the system but will NOT
      appear in the action log, the ban list, the USL site search bar, or the USL browser extension.
      The bans are still being tracked and working as intended, but they are not visible to anyone
      outside of the moderation team.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to use private tags in your communities, please reach out to RegExr to get set up
      with a new tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Subscribing to New Tags</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to subscribe your community to a new tag, please edit your community's
      configuration located in your community's wiki page. Please view
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname/wiki/usl_config/"
        >https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname/wiki/usl_config/</a
      >
      where <code>subredditname</code> is the name of your community. From here, you can edit the
      config to add or remove tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you update and save the config, the bot will send you a PM indicating the status of your
      update. If the update was successful, no further action is required from you. However, if the
      update was unsuccessful, the bot will reset the config and ask you to try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To correctly update the config, please add new tags to the line starting with
      <code>tags:</code>. Each tag should be separated by a comma. You can have whitespace on either
      side of the comma and the # character is not required. The bot will do its best to parse your
      changes and modify it to a format it expects. If, for any reason, you cannot get your change
      to go through, please contact RegExr for assistance.
    </p>
    <h3>Typo Checking</h3>
    <p>
      Occasionally, moderators make typos when issuing bans. If you want the USL to spell-check you,
      please enable the 'typo_checking' feature by navigating to your sub's config page at
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname/wiki/usl_config/"
        >https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditname/wiki/usl_config/</a
      >
      where <code>subredditname</code> is the name of your community. From here, you can edit the
      <code>typo_checking</code> value from False to True. This will enable the typo checking
      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the feature has been enabled, the bot will start to check for typos in ban notes. If the
      bot identifies an unknown tag in a ban note, it will send a PM to the moderator who issued the
      ban informing them as such. The bot will only issue bans if a known tag is present in the ban
      note. So if the moderator did, in fact, make a typo, they should issue a <b>local unban</b>,
      then reissue the ban with the properly spelled tag in the ban note.
