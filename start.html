		<h3>Getting Started with The Universal Scammer List</h3>
		<p>If you represent a community on Reddit that primarily deals with Buy/Sell/Trade transactions and are interested in increasing security and removing scammers, read on!</p>
		<p>The Universal Scammer List (USL) is the system supporting a collection of subreddits who agree to work together to limit the impact that those who have scammed or have shown the intention to scam can have on community members. By participating in the USL, you can both benefit from and contribute back to the system.</p>
		<h3>Getting Bans from the USL</h3>
		<p>The most important type of access for all communities is "Read" access. This will enable your community to read bans from the system and have them be automatically applied to your community. For example, if someone is banned from r/FunkoSwap for being a scammer, that user will also be banned on your community as well. This prevents them from jumping ship and scamming in your community, protecting your community members along the way.</p>
		<p>Getting read permissions is simple. Because your community does not contribute back to the USL in Read mode, there are no qualifications to join. The sections below will describe the steps you must take to join.</p>
		<h3>Writing Bans to the USL</h3>
		<p>In order to contribute back to the USL, you'll need to have "write" permissions within the system. Because labeling users as scammers is serious business, there are tighter requirements to join the USL with write permissions. The sections below will cover how to get write access.</p>
		<p>If you are accepted to the USL with write permissions, please review the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page for more information on how to use the USL.
		<h3>Getting Access to the USL</h3>
		<p>If you wish to have read only access to the USL, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r%2FUniversalScammerList">send a message</a> to the USL admins indicating as such.</p>
		<p>If you would like to be considered for read AND write access, please <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r%2FUniversalScammerList&subject=We%20would%20like%20to%20join%20the%20USL&message=%2A%2AImportant%2A%2A%20-%20please%20designate%20one%20of%20your%20moderators%20to%20message%20the%20r%2FUniversalScammerList%20modmail%20inbox%20with%20your%20answers%20to%20the%20below%0A%0AHello%2C%0A%0AThank%20you%20for%20your%20consideration%20in%20joining%20the%20universal%20scammer%20list.%0A%0A%0AIn%20order%20to%20join%20the%20universal%20scammer%20list%2C%20please%20respond%20with%20answers%20to%20the%20following%20questions%3A%0A%0A1.%20Joining%20the%20universal%20scammer%20list%20means%20you%20agree%20to%20use%20the%20%2A%2Aban%20note%2A%2A%20in%20a%20%2Aconsistent%2A%20way.%20The%20ban%20note%20is%20the%20moderator-only%20viewable%20message%20that%20is%20visible%20on%20the%20ban%20page.%20Has%20your%20subreddit%20previously%20used%20a%20pound%20symbol%20%2F%20hashtag%20%28%23%29%20in%20the%20ban%20note%20as%20an%20indicator%20of%20why%20the%20ban%20occured%3F%20If%20so%2C%20give%20some%20examples%3A%0A%0A2.%20How%20do%20you%20intend%20to%20use%20the%20universal%20scammer%20list%3F%201-2%20sentences%0A%0A3.%20Do%20you%20want%20to%20receive%20a%20modmail%20PM%20whenever%20the%20USLBot%20takes%20an%20action%20on%20your%20subreddit%20%28referring%20to%20silent%20mode%29%3F%20These%20will%20be%20frequent.%20Yes%2FNo%0A%0A4.%20Does%20your%20subreddit%20want%20to%20be%20in%20read-only%20or%20write-only%20mode%2C%20or%20neither%3F%20Neither%20is%20the%20standard%20option%2C%20but%20it%27s%20your%20decision%0A%0A5.%20What%20tags%20do%20you%20want%20to%20follow%20%28see%20usage%20guide%29%3F%20These%20refer%20to%20types%20on%20users%20which%20you%20do%20not%20want%20to%20allow%20to%20participate%20on%20your%20subreddit.%20This%20must%20include%20at%20least%201%20tag.%0A%0A6.%20Does%20your%20subreddit%20already%20follow%2C%20or%20plan%20on%20following%2C%20any%20type%20of%20tag%20system%20that%20does%20not%20fit%20with%20the%20existing%20tags%3F%20If%20so%2C%20list%20all%20of%20the%20tags%2C%20how%20they%20are%20being%20used%2C%20and%20if%20you%20would%20like%20to%20submit%20them%20as%20official%20tags%20for%20other%20members%20of%20the%20universal%20scammer%20list%20to%20use.%0A%0A7.%20Do%20you%20have%20any%20%22sister%20subreddits%22%2C%20which%20share%20a%20head%20moderator%20or%20a%20significant%20amount%20by%20activity%20of%20your%20moderator%20team%3F%20If%20so%2C%20list%20the%20sister%20subreddits%20and%20explain%20their%20relation%20to%20the%20main%20subreddit.%20NOTE%3A%20Do%20not%20list%20subreddits%20with%20fewer%20than%201000%20subscribers.%0A%0A8.%20Please%20send%20a%20moderator%20invite%20to%20the%20%2Fu%2FUSLBot%20with%20%22access%22%20permissions%20or%20higher%0A%0A9.%20We%20invite%20at%20least%20one%20moderator%20of%20each%20participating%20subreddit%20to%20become%20a%20moderator%20of%20r%2FUniversalScammerList.%20Please%20discuss%20among%20yourselves%20who%20you%27d%20like%20this%20to%20be%0A%0A">click this link</a> to send a message to the USL admins and answer the following questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Joining the universal scammer list means you agree to use the **ban note** in a *consistent* way. The ban note is the moderator-only viewable message that is visible on the ban page. Has your subreddit previously used a pound symbol / hashtag (#) in the ban note as an indicator of why the ban occured? If so, give some examples:</li>
			<li>How do you intend to use the universal scammer list? 1-2 sentences</li>
			<li>Do you want to receive a modmail PM whenever the USLBot takes an action on your subreddit (referring to silent mode)? These will be frequent. Yes/No</li>
			<li>Does your subreddit want to be in read-only or write-only mode, or neither? Neither is the standard option, but it's your decision.</li>
			<li>What tags do you want to follow (see usage guide)? These refer to types on users which you do not want to allow to participate on your subreddit. This must include at least 1 tag.</li>
			<li>Does your subreddit already follow, or plan on following, any type of tag system that does not fit with the existing tags? If so, list all of the tags, how they are being used, and if you would like to submit them as official tags for other members of the universal scammer list to use.</li>
			<li>Do you have any "sister subreddits", which share a head moderator or a significant amount by activity of your moderator team? If so, list the sister subreddits and explain their relation to the main subreddit. NOTE: Do not list subreddits with fewer than 1000 subscribers.</li>
			<li>Please send a moderator invite to the /u/USLBot with "access" permissions or higher.</li>
			<li>We invite at least one moderator of each participating subreddit to become a moderator of r/UniversalScammerList. Please discuss among yourselves who you'd like this to be.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After we process your response, a response will be sent indicating your status with the USL.</p>
		<h3>After You Get USL Access</h3>
		<p>If you are granted read and/or write access to the USL, a new USL bot account will be created specifically for your subreddit. Please add that account as a moderator to your subreddit with the following permissions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manage Users</li>
			<li>Manage Mod Mail</li>
			<li>Manage Wiki Pages</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of course, you're welcome to give more permissions to the bot, but these are the minimum it needs to operate correctly. Once you've added the bot with the proper permissions, it will start working on your sub, applying bans as they come in.</p>
		<h3>Subscribing to Tags</h3>
		<p>The default setting is for any community to be subscribed to the #scammer tag. If you wish to subscribe to more tags, please read the "Subscribing to New Tags" section of the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page for more information.</p>
