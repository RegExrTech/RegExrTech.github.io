    <h3>Getting Started with The Universal Scammer List</h3>
    <p>
      If you represent a community on Reddit that primarily deals with Buy/Sell/Trade transactions
      and are interested in increasing security and removing scammers, read on!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Universal Scammer List (USL) is the system supporting a collection of subreddits who agree
      to work together to limit the impact that those who have scammed or have shown the intention
      to scam can have on community members. By participating in the USL, you can both benefit from
      and contribute back to the system.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Bans from the USL</h3>
    <p>
      The most important type of access for all communities is "Read" access. This will enable your
      community to read bans from the system and have them be automatically applied to your
      community. For example, if someone is banned from r/FunkoSwap for being a scammer, that user
      will also be banned on your community as well. This prevents them from jumping ship and
      scamming in your community, protecting your community members along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting read permissions is simple. Because your community does not contribute back to the USL
      in Read mode, there are no qualifications to join. The sections below will describe the steps
      you must take to join.
    </p>
    <h3>Writing Bans to the USL</h3>
    <p>
      In order to contribute back to the USL, you'll need to have "write" permissions within the
      system. Because labeling users as scammers is serious business, there are tighter requirements
      to join the USL with write permissions. The sections below will cover how to get write access.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are accepted to the USL with write permissions, please review the
      <a href="/about.html">About</a> page for more information on how to use the USL.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Access to the USL</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to have read only access to the USL, please verify your sub meets the minimum requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Your sub has existed for at least 3 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your sub has had an average of one post per day for the last 3 months.
      </li>
    </ul>

      to send a message to the USL admins and answer the following questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Joining the universal scammer list means you agree to use the **ban note** in a *consistent*
        way. The ban note is the moderator-only viewable message that is visible on the ban page.
        Has your subreddit previously used a pound symbol / hashtag (#) in the ban note as an
        indicator of why the ban occured? If so, give some examples:
      </li>
      <li>What benefits will your sub gain from being a part of the Universal Scammer List?</li>
      <li>
        Does your subreddit want to be in read-only mode, write-only mode, or read/write mode.
        Read/write is the standard option.
      </li>
      <li>
        What tags do you want to follow (see usage guide)? These refer to types on users which you
        do not want to allow to participate on your subreddit. This must include at least 1 tag.
        Examples include scammer and sketchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Does your subreddit already follow, or plan on following, any type of tag system that does
        not fit with the existing tags? If so, list all of the tags, how they are being used, and if
        you would like to submit them as official tags for other members of the universal scammer
        list to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you represent any other subreddits which could benefit from being included in the USL? If
        so, please list them here but also file a separate application for each subreddit.
      </li>
      <li>
        We invite at least one moderator of each participating subreddit to become a moderator of
        r/UniversalScammerList. Please discuss among yourselves who you'd like this to be and
        include their name here.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After we process your response, a reply will be sent indicating your status with the USL.
    </p>
    <h3>After You Get USL Access</h3>
    <p>
      If you are granted read and/or write access to the USL, a new USL bot account will be created
      specifically for your subreddit. Please add that account as a moderator to your subreddit with
      the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage Users</li>
      <li>Manage Mod Mail</li>
      <li>Manage Wiki Pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, you're welcome to give more permissions to the bot, but these are the minimum it
      needs to operate correctly. Once you've added the bot with the proper permissions, it will
      start working on your sub, applying bans as they come in.
    </p>
    <h3>Subscribing to Tags</h3>
    <p>
      The default setting is for any community to be subscribed to the #scammer tag. If you wish to
      subscribe to more tags, please read the "Subscribing to New Tags" section of the
      <a href="/about.html">About</a> page for more information.
