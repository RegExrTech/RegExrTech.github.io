    <h3>USL Voting Results</h3>
    <p>
      Occasionally, the USL mods will vote on matters to determine how the group should proceed. Those results will be written below. Please note that this page is not listed on the USL site and you will need a direct URL to get here.
    </p>
    <h2>USL Admission Rules</h3>
    <p>
      When a subreddit is applying for read-only access, subscriber count is not considered, but subs must have 3 months of history and at least three months of activity, defined as an average of one or more posts per day over the last 3 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a subreddit is applying for read and write-access, subs must have 5,000 or more subscribers and have existed for at least 6 months, along with at least three months of activity, defined as an average of one or more posts per day over the last 3 months.
    </p>
    <h2>USL Voting Rules</h2>
    <p>
      All USL mods may only ever cast ONE vote per issue, regardless of how many subs they moderate
    </p>
    <p>
      Each sub may only have one vote cased on its behalf. This means that if two users respond to a poll and they both represent the same sub, only the first response will be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only subreddits with write access to the USL may be represented in USL votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any moderator of r/UniversalScammerList can reply to a poll (provided another representative of their sub has not already replied), regardless of how active they are within the USL and within their own subs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polls will be sent via reddit direct message to all users who moderate a USL sub with write access and are listed as moderators of r/UniversalScammerList.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users who receive direct messages to participate in polls will also have a unique code associated with that message. Users will need to paste that code into the linked survey for their response to be accepted. This is to prevent a potentially rogue moderator from submitting responses on behalf of other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Votes are decided by super majority. That is, an option only proceeds if it has more than 50% of the votes. A runoff vote of the two highest scoring options occurs if no option receives over 50% of the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voting will remain open for 72 hours.
    </p>
    <h2>USL Mod Mail Etiquette</h2>
    <p>
      If something requires no further attention and only required an objective response, it can be archived as soon as it is handled.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example: A user sent a message asking for read access when they really just wanted to look up a username.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: A user complained about being on the USL but they were redirected to the sub that banned them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If something requires multiple moderator opinions OR has generated discussion, it can be archived 3 days after a resolution has been reached.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example: A new sub wants to join the USL
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: Moderators are discussing various behaviors, prompted by a message from a user.
      </li>
    </ul>
